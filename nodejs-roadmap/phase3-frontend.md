# Phase 3 – Frontend & Full‑Stack Integration

## Goals
- Master React with TypeScript to build dynamic frontend applications.
- Learn how to consume backend APIs and manage state in a full-stack context.
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and Next.js for better performance and SEO.

## Topics & Resources
- **React fundamentals**: components, JSX, hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext). Resources: [React docs](https://react.dev/).
- **TypeScript with React**: typing props, state, hooks and generics.
- **State Management**: React Context, Redux Toolkit, Zustand or TanStack Query for data fetching & caching.
- **API Integration**: consuming REST/GraphQL APIs, handling authentication tokens.
- **Next.js**: pages, routing, `getServerSideProps`, API routes.
- **UI Frameworks**: Tailwind CSS or Material UI for building responsive UIs.
- **Testing**: React Testing Library and Jest for component/unit tests.

## Practice Tasks
- Build a simple React dashboard that interfaces with your Phase 2 API (e.g., list products, create/edit orders).
- Implement authentication flows (login, signup) connecting to the backend.
- Migrate the dashboard to Next.js with SSR for some pages (e.g., product listing).
- Use TypeScript throughout your components and hooks.
- Add unit tests for key components and integration tests for API interactions.

## Deliverables
- A `phase3-frontend` subfolder containing a React/Next.js project integrated with your backend.
- Documentation on how to run the frontend and connect it to the backend.
- Screenshots or a demo link showing the dashboard in action.
